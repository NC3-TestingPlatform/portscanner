"""Shared result dataclasses and enums for portscanner.

The scanner shells out to ``nmap -oX -`` and hands the XML to the
`nmap2json <https://github.com/D4-project/nmap2json>`_ library, which returns
one dict per host. Those dicts are converted into the typed objects defined
here. :class:`ScanReport` is the top-level aggregate returned by
:func:`portscanner.assessor.assess`.

This module is *inventory only*: it records open ports and detected services.
It assigns no letter grade and no severity — per the platform convention,
grading is reserved for ``mailvalidator`` and ``headersvalidator``.
